# Brazilian-E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Using-PostgreSQL

This project analyzes real-world Brazilian e-commerce transaction data containing over 100,000 orders. 
The goal was to design a relational database schema, import large-scale CSV data into PostgreSQL, 
and perform business-driven SQL analysis to generate insights about sales performance, customer behavior, delivery efficiency, and payment trends.

The project simulates real-world Data Analyst responsibilities including database modeling, KPI analysis, and business reporting.

The database consists of 9 interconnected tables:
customers
orders
order_items
products
sellers
order_payments
order_reviews
geolocation
product_category_name_translation
